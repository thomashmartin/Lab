# <span style="color:#a98700">04</span> Steam Distillation and Chracterization of Clove Oil from Cloves

## Objectives

The objective of this experiment is to prepare the reagents required to make the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction and then combine these reagents to obserbe the phenomena.

## Introduction

The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a common example of a nonlinear oscillating reaction. In this experiment, a 25 mM 1,10-phenanthroline iron(II) sulfate complex is used as a catalyst and as a redox indicator to illustrate the periodic color change from reddish orange to blue throughout the complex reactions taking place in the mixture.


## Experimental


The reaction mixture consists of three different solutions A, B, and C.

A: 67 cm³ of distilled water + 2.0 cm³ of conc. sulfuric acid + 5.0 g of sodium bromate

B: 1.0 g of malonic acid + 10 cm³ of distilled water

C: 1.0 g of sodium bromide + 10 cm³ of distilled water

The 25 mM 1,10-phenanthroline iron(II) sulfate complex, also known as ferroin, was made by dissolving 0.135 g of 1,10-phenanthroline and 0.0695 g of iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate in 10 cm³ of distilled water. 

6 cm³ of A, 1.0 cm³ of B, and 0.50 cm³ of C were combined in a petri dish and stirred occasionally. After about 3 minutes, 1.0 cm³ of the ferroin solution was added and stirred until a homogenous mixture was obtained. Note, that sometimes when the ferroin is added, a precipitate forms. If this happens, the solution needs to be stirred until the precipitate disappears.

## Reaction Mechanism


The reaction is initiated when the oxygen atom of the C=O group of the benzoic acid molecule attacks a proton released from the acid catalyst. However, this formed intermediate is not in its most stable form, and thus it resonates to a form where the electron-deficient region exists around the central carbon atom - thus forming a tertiary carbocation which is relatively stable. Then the electron-dense oxygen atom of the methanol molecule attacks this carbocation intermediate. After which, a proton transfer occurs at the oxonium ion site and the proton transfers to any of the other bases in the reaction mixture abbreviated as B. An oxygen atom of any hydroxyl group will then attack a proton, forming a new oxonium ion that can act as a good leaving group. An electron pair of adjacent oxygen in the hydroxyl group will then "push out" the oxonium ion leaving group. Lastly, the new oxonium ion is deprotonated with the help of a water molecule and an ester is formed. This reaction mechanism was adapted from (2).
