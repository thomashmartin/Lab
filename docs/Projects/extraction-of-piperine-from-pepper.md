# <span style="color:#a98700">05</span> Extraction of Piperine from Black Pepper


## Objectives

The objective of this experiment is to extract and purify piperine from black peppers by soxhlet extraction. The purity and characterization of the extracts is validated using GC-MS. Moreover, the existence of piperine is confirmed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC).
