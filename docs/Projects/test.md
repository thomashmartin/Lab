# <span style="color:#a98700">03</span> Acid-catalyzed Dehydration of Cyclohexanol into Cyclohexene

## Objectives
{: .pt-3}

The objective of this experiment is to catalytically dehydrate cyclohexanol with phosphoric acid to yield cyclohexene, a cyclic alkene. The cyclohexene is isolated via fractional distillation and its existence is confirmed with bromine water, which is a reagent used to distinguish between alkanes and alkenes.

## Introduction

The catalytic dehydration reaction of cyclohexanol with phosphoric acid is an example of an endothermic equilibrium elimination reaction where a secondary alcohol group is removed and an alkene group is formed via the E1 pathway. Even though the overall reaction is endothermic, there are exothermic components to the equilibrium reaction due to bonds being formed. However, the reaction is overall endothermic because a C-O bond is broken which is a highly endothermic process.

Most dehydration reactions are kinetically very slow and energetically unfavourable (1). Therefore, the reaction conditions are usually controlled to increase the rate of reaction and to make the equilibrium product-favoured. In this experiment, the rate of reaction is increased by heating the mixture, using a catalyst, and continuously removing the formed water and cyclohexene via fractional distillation which alters the dominant equilibrium concentration position.

A catalyst plays an important role in dehydration reactions as it affects the rate at which an equilibrium is established. Catalysts do so by lowering the activation energy of both the forward and reverse reactions, thus altering the rate at which equilibrium is established. In this instance, the reaction is catalyzed by 85% phosphoric acid which protonates the hydroxyl group, a poor leaving group, making it a cationic species which is a good leaving group. Thus making the reaction more likely to occur as the energy required for the hydroxyl group to be ejected is much lower when it is protonated. It is important to note, however, that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium positions of reactions, and it does not affect the Gibbs free energy of the overall reaction.

Another important consideration in this reaction is the usage of fractional distillation which is a technique used to precisely separate compounds by their boiling points (BP). Fractional distillation works by passing a vaporized mixture of compounds through a long fractionating column. In this column, the vapour mixture begins to condense but the heat of rising vapour causes the more volatile compounds to move along the column to the condenser. While the less volatile compounds drop back to the reaction mixture. This ensures that a higher purity distillate is obtained. In this reaction, fractional distillation ensures that only cyclohexene, BP: 83°C (2), and water, BP: 100°C, carry over the fractionating column since their boiling points are significantly lower than that for cyclohexanol, BP: 162°C (3).


### Experimental
{: .pt-3}

A mixture of cyclohexanol (24 cm3, 23 g, 230 mmol) and 85% phosphoric acid (11 cm3) was fractionally distilled whilst keeping the temperature of the vapour below 100°C. The distillate was washed with brine (8 cm3) and the crude product dried over anhydrous CaCl2 to yield cyclohexene as a transparent fluid (13.41 g, 160 mmol, yield 71%). A bromine test was performed on the product.


### Reaction Mechanism
{: .pt-3}

The reaction is initiated when the nucleophilic oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group attacks a proton originating from the dissociation of the phosphoric acid molecule. This forms an oxonium ion intermediate and a dihydrogen phosphate ion. Given that water is a very good leaving group, the C-O bond is broken with both of the electrons going to the oxygen atom. As a result, a cyclic carbocation is formed which is immediately deprotonated by the dihydrogen phosphate ion to form cyclohexene and phosphoric acid. All of these reactions are reversible, but due to the reaction conditions, the right-hand side equilibrium concentration position is dominant.


### Results


Qualitative observations: the cyclohexanol-phosphoric acid mixture was opaque before distillation and turned yellow after the distillation. The brown bromine water turned colourless in the presence of the product.

### Discussion
 


A bromine test was performed on the obtained product and it confirmed that an alkene was indeed present as the brown bromine water turned colourless.

A 71% yield of cyclohexene was obtained for the experimental catalytic dehydration of cyclohexanol. The typical yield for this reaction is 80% (5) which means that the experimental yield only differs by 9% from the typical yield. Therefore, it may be said that the experimental yield of cyclohexene was very high. Such a high yield can be attributed to a multitude of factors. The largest contributors to the high yield were the following: (a) high concentration of efficient catalyst, (b) heating the reaction under reflux, (c) continuous removal of products.
{: .pb-4}

The usage of a large amount of the 85% phosphoric acid catalyst is the largest contributor to the high yield of the dehydration reaction of cyclohexanol. This is because the E1 mechanistic elimination of the hydroxyl group in the absence of a catalyst is energetically highly unfavourable and kinetically highly unlikely to occur. This reaction is energetically unfavourable and unlikely to occur because the hydroxyl group is a poor leaving group due to -OH being a very strong base forming a strong C-O bond. However, in the presence of the acid catalyst, the nucleophilic oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is protonated, forming a very good leaving group. Thus the reaction proceeds much faster as this leaving group is very likely to leave given that the energy barrier to doing so is much smaller compared to the hydroxyl group acting as a leaving group. Therefore, the 85% phosphoric acid catalyst decreases the activation energy of the reaction to occur and thus increases the rate at which equilibrium is established.

The fact that the reaction mixture is continuously heated at reflux during the fractional distillation causes the yield to increase significantly. This is because the dehydration reaction of cyclohexanol is overall endothermic due to the highly endothermic nature of the C-O bond cleavage. Hence, as heat is supplied to the reaction mixture, the equilibrium concentration position of the reaction is pushed to the right, producing more cyclohexene. This is supported by Le Chatelier’s principle.

The third significant contributor to the high yield is the second alteration of the dominant equilibrium concentration position of the reaction. This is done by continuously removing the formed water and cyclohexene from the reaction mixture via fractional distillation. This continuous removal of products pushes the equilibrium of the reaction towards right according to Le Chatelier’s principle. Simultaneously, increasing the yield of cyclohexene.

Sources of systematic error were kept relatively low throughout the experiment by using an analytical balance, using high-purity reagents, and manually recovering as much of the product as possible during the washings and other procedures. Furthermore, the crude product was dried over anhydrous CaCl2 which ensures that no water is present in the sample. This is important as the removal of water makes the yield calculation more accurate. The largest source of systematic error in the calculation of the percentage yield occurs when the cyclohexanol was poured into the reaction vessel. This is because the cyclohexanol was measured volumetrically in a relatively cold room. This allowed some of the viscous cyclohexanol to stick to the sides and bottom of the graduated cylinder. Therefore, only an approximate amount of cyclohexanol was poured into the flask. To increase the accuracy of the yield calculation, it would have been necessary to weigh out exactly how much cyclohexanol was added to the flask instead of measuring it out volumetrically. It is also important to note that some of the product is lost as it evaporates and some of it was stuck on the walls of the fractional distillation apparatus. To increase the overall accuracy of the percentage yield, it would be important to consider multiple trials of the reaction as this decreases the extent of random error.
