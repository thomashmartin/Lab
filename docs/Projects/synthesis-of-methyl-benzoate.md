# <span style="color:#a98700">02</span> Synthesis of Methyl Benzoate

## Objectives

The objective of this experiment is to prepare methyl benzoate by a Fischer esterification reaction between methanol and benzoic acid. The existence of methyl benzoate is confirmed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC).

## Introduction

A Fischer esterification reaction is an equilibrium reaction where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester and water (1). In all esterification reactions, the carboxylic acid acts as an electrophile and the alcohol acts as  a nucleophile. Electrophiles are species that accept electrons and nucleophiles are species that donate electrons.

Most Fischer esterification reactions are kinetically very slow and energetically unfavourable. Therefore the reaction conditions are usually controlled to increase the rate of reaction and to make the equilibrium product-favoured. In this experiment, the rate of reaction is increased with strong reflux and a concentrated sulfuric acid catalyst. Moreover, a large excess of methanol is used to shift the equilibrium towards the left to increase the yield of the ester: using an excess of methanol shifts the equilibrium to the left according to Le Chatelier's principle. In many industrial applications, the equilibrium of the Fischer esterification reaction is made product-favoured by removing the water that forms during the reaction. This is important because the water that forms during the reaction between the carboxylic acid and alcohol reacts with the ester to form back the reactants. Therefore, when water is removed, the yield of the ester increases.
The catalytic dehydration reaction of cyclohexanol with phosphoric acid is an example of an endothermic equilibrium elimination reaction where a secondary alcohol group is removed and an alkene group is formed via the E1 pathway. Even though the overall reaction is endothermic, there are exothermic components to the equilibrium reaction due to bonds being formed. However, the reaction is overall endothermic because a C-O bond is broken which is a highly endothermic process. 


## Experimental


Benzoic acid (10.05 ± 0.01 g, 0.08230 mol) dissolved in methanol (40 cm³ ± 1.0 %, 99% purity) was refluxed for 30 minutes in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid (2 cm³ ± 1.0 %, 98% purity). Boiling chips were also present during the reflux. The reaction mixture was poured into a separating funnel along with water (100 cm³) and extracted twice with dichloromethane (2 x 40 cm³). The organic extracts were washed with aq. sodium carbonate (30 cm³, 5%), followed by a wash with water (100 cm³). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and transferred to a preweighed round-bottom flask. The DCM was removed from the extract using a rotary evaporator at 40°C. A TLC sample was taken from the mixture right before refluxing and after refluxing.$$\textsuperscript{th}$$

## Reaction Mechanism


The reaction is initiated when the oxygen atom of the C=O group of the benzoic acid molecule attacks a proton released from the acid catalyst. However, this formed intermediate is not in its most stable form, and thus it resonates to a form where the electron-deficient region exists around the central carbon atom - thus forming a tertiary carbocation which is relatively stable. Then the electron-dense oxygen atom of the methanol molecule attacks this carbocation intermediate. After which, a proton transfer occurs at the oxonium ion site and the proton transfers to any of the other bases in the reaction mixture abbreviated as B. An oxygen atom of any hydroxyl group will then attack a proton, forming a new oxonium ion that can act as a good leaving group. An electron pair of adjacent oxygen in the hydroxyl group will then "push out" the oxonium ion leaving group. Lastly, the new oxonium ion is deprotonated with the help of a water molecule and an ester is formed. This reaction mechanism was adapted from (2).

## Discussion
 
The existence of methyl benzoate can be seen by the increase of the number of distinct spots on the TLC plate. As seen from table 1, there exists only one spot for the SM column, which corresponds to benzoic acid. However, there exist two spots for the PM column. The lower one corresponds to benzoic acid since it has a similar pattern and length as in the SM column, and it is known that all of the benzoic acid did not react, therefore it must be benzoic acid. The length of the benzoic acid spot is shorter in the PM column since its concentration was lower in the product mixture as some of the benzoic acid was consumed to form a product. It is very likely that the upper spot in the PM column corresponds to methyl benzoate. This can be further supported with Rf values: the top spot has an Rf of 0.81 and the bottom spot has an Rf of 0.27. This suggests that the compound in the upper spot is less polar than the benzoic acid in the lower spot. This is because the larger the Rf value is, the less affinity it has towards the polar silica stationary phase, the more the substance travels up, and thus the less polar it is. Structurally, methyl benzoate is not capable of hydrogen bonding given that it does not have a hydroxyl group whereas benzoic acid does. Thus, it can be said that methyl benzoate is less polar than benzoic acid. This confirms that the upper spot in the PM column is indeed methyl benzoate.

The validity of the TLC was confirmed using a control spot with both PM and SM mixtures added to it. They show a very similar pattern as in both the SM and PM spots. However, to reduce the incidence of random and systematic error, multiple different TLC plates could have been utilised.

An 82% yield of methyl benzoate was obtained from the reaction. It is, however, likely that this is an overestimation of the actual yield. This is because the refluxing time was relatively short, only 30 minutes, and no water was removed from the refluxing mixture. It is likely that the rotary evaporator did not remove all of the DCM from the solution. This is possible given that the vacuum pump was old and could not sustain a high level of suction. Furthermore, the duration of the rotary evaporation could have been increased to aim for a higher level of solvent removal. However, it could be possible that the 82% yield is valid. This is because the reaction was well controlled: the reflux was strong, the reagents were of analytical grade, a large molar excess of methanol was used, and a relatively large amount of concentrated sulfuric acid catalyst was used. The large excess of methanol is likely a significant contributor to a high yield since it pushes the equilibrium towards the right according to Le Chatelier’s principle.

To confirm the actual percentage of methyl benzoate present in the sample it would be necessary to distill the sample. This would eliminate the possibility of any DCM remaining given that the boiling point of DCM 39.75°C is significantly lower than that of methyl benzoate 199°C.
