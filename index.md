# Welcome to My Lab.

Hi there, I am excited to share my journey in the lab with you. Feel free to browse through my projects on the left.

I am a first-year chemistry student at Princeton University and I have a special interest in organic chemistry and natural extractives.

You can email me at tm2501(at)princeton.edu
